				<h2>Tree Pruning</h2>
				<p>
					We pay close attention to correct and proper pruning techniques. This involves avoiding damage to the cambium, promoting strong healthy branching, and creating visual aesthetics. Proper pruning techniques increase longevity and reduce chances of pest and disease attacks. As urban trees lack the natural shade provided in forest environments, yearly to bi-yearly pruning is structurally essential for trees in cities and suburbs.

				<h2>Tree Removal</h2>
				<p>
					Urban forestry can sometimes involve the necessary removal of trees. Whether in poor health, hazardous, or just in a bad location, we're here to address your small to mid-sized tree removal needs. Our workers are experienced in arboriculture, Climbing, rigging, and safe practices. Wood is removed (if desired) and recycled as needed followed by a full cleanup when complete.

				<h2>Hedge Trimming</h2>
				<p>
					Whether regular maintenance is needed or hedges have become too high to reach, we're here to help. Straight cuts and aesthetics are emphasized and we're also mindful of the long-term health of your hedge structure. We address the needs of each species, their current state, condition, and future challenges such as the loss of inner foliage resulting in "leggy" growth.

				<h2>Planting</h2>
				<p>
					We usually plant trees up to approximately 6 to 10ft tall with a 20" wide root ball. This is the ideal maximum size in terms of practicality and growth establishment time. It usually involves a two person crew to deliver, dig, mix in soil ammendments, and plant. We are careful how we plant, and use best practices to decrease transplant shock and increase tree survival rates.

				<h2>Tree Bracing</h2>
				<p>
					When faced with a hazerdous branch or stem there are usually three options: removal, reduction, or bracing. While removal and reduction are the most common practices, bracing can make trees safer with minimal intervention. This can be particularly useful for long splits running down trunks or large stems extend over homes or public walkways. Bracing is a less agressive approach, helping both tree health and personal accountability.

				<h2>Tree Risk Assessment</h2>
				<p>
					In nature, trees shed branches, split and die. This process provides shelder for wildlife, increases biodiversity, and enriches the forest floor. But this natural process can become a threat to pedestrians and property when placed in an urban environment. We're here to provide free consulting of potential tree hazards during estimates, while working, and at job completion. Some other consulting subjects include Planting and health care recommendations, and sustainable landscaping practices.
