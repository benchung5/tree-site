						<p>
							We pay close attention to correct and proper pruning techniques. This involves avoiding damage to the cambium, promoting strong healthy branching, and creating visual aesthetics. Proper pruning techniques increase longevity and reduce chances of pest and disease attacks. As urban trees lack the natural shade provided in forest environments, yearly to bi-yearly pruning is structurally essential for trees in cities and suburbs.
